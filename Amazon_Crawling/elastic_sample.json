          "Light, comfortable and clean beautiful design. They are warm but not overwhelmingly so. Details in the mid and high are clear and non fatiguing. They lack in the bass for my personal preference, but a mild tune with a digital EQ can get the slam I prefer. Highly recommend for easy listening and the price to performance is hard to beat.",
          "These are incredible headphones. They have a rich and vibrant sound with deep punchy bass and precise crisp highs. They are lightweight and comfortable to wear; I can wear for them long binge-watch sessions as well as extended music listening. They do benefit from some breaking in and maybe a bit of tweaking in a program like Peace or Voicemeter to tune the levels.\n\nMy favorite part of these headphones is how lightweight and comfortable they are when wearing them for long periods of time as well as the overall sound quality. The closed backs provide an excellent soundscape while maintaining privacy and accentuating the punch of the bass.\n\nThese are clear, precise, and get loud with ease ( I use them with a Fios amp).\n\nI would definitely recommend these headphones for someone seeking a premium, fantastic sounding, comfortable pair of headphones.",
          "Ok so I don't use audiophile terms really, alot of them I'm not sure if I really even understand haha. I do own several headphones, somewhere around 50ish over the ears. I run them off my phone with a fiio a3 or I run them off my Yamaha home stereo receiver hooked to a liquid spark amp. Very modest indeed. The only details I'll get into besides sound is comfort because looks and build speak for them selves, they're awesome. The comfort is perfect, once on your head you forget they are even there. Unlike the jaw breaking force of the Sennheisers. Or the super loose fit of say the sph9500. Ok so now on to the sound!\n\nSOUND PART OF MY REVIEW: as I said, I don't really use alot of audiophile terms I am better at understanding sound by comparison to other headphones or speakers. So at $200 to $300 bucks you have some real heavy hitters. You have alot of great options. To name a few of them I'm guessing you either own or are trying to decide from. You have the Sennheisers 58x, 6xx, 600 and 650. You've also got the likes of hifiman 400i and 4xx the Phillips Fidelio x2hr and the Beyer 770,880,990 just to name a few I foolishly own over 3/4 of these so I feel as if I can speak with pretty good knowledge of what you can expect. So the star of the show, THE BASS! These to me have the best/most bass of the lot. Sub bass is great, snappy drum bass is great, low end grunt from guitars and other stringed instruments is awesome. Mid range is very warm and cozy with very little bass bleed, which is amazing for how much thump these have. The mids are only rivaled by the 58x and 600 variants. I cannot honestly say which is better they're just two different flavors but both equally delicious. The meze is warm and extremely present mixed with Bass where as the Sennheisers are getting very present with much less warrants from bass but so extremely accurate it's almost a religious experience lol. Now the high-end is where things become very difficult. The 99s do not offer the high quality antalitical effortless hight end of the Sennheisers or the planar hifimans but what you get in return is a rolled off super sweet relaxing hight end. Like a very good vinyl pressing compared to a CD if you will. So overall if you want accurate amazing time tested reference sound go with the Sennheisers, if you want hard to drive bassless but very good mids and highs go with hifiman. If you want overall performer with strong v shaped sound and amazing soundstage get the x2s. If your like me and love your bass, and want amazing mids, soundstage and comfort with easy on the ear treble get these meze 99 classic or neo! If I could only have one of these headphones it would be a real hard choice between the 58x and these meze 99s but I'm pretty sure I would take the meze 99. Best bass, best looks, best out of the box accessories and easiest to drive (nothing more than a cellphone required) I hope I was able to give something of an idea of what to expect from these.",
          "SOUND: I've had these headphones for almost a year now. When I was shopping for headphones, I wanted something with a warm sound signature and good bass. I am very treble sensitive and these headphones have the perfect sound signature. I listen to a lot of synth-pop and EDM, music sounds fun and exciting. The bass doesn't 'slam', it's more about the sub-bass which I feel are these headphone's bread and butter.\n\nGAMING: Very cinematic in games and sounds really good especially in single-player games. However, because these are closed back headphones I don't think the sound stage is great, it can feel a bit 'cramped', and these probably aren't the best for FPS games.\n\nCOMFORT: Unfortunately, I don't find these as comfortable as other folks claim. Even after stretching these out there is still a noticeable clamp and adjusting them can be uncomfortable. The cord is awful and splits very close to your neck and there is no way to adjust it; I find the cord frequently rubbing up against my neck and it's very irritating. The pads can become hot and sweaty; I actually bought memory foam pads to replace them because the stock ones are so bad, but unfortunately the memory foam ruined the sound signature of these headphones. I usually wear my headphones all day but I frequently find myself taking these off whenever I can and is a big reason I'm looking to replace these even though I love the sound signature.\n\nOverall, these headphones sport a warm, bass heavy sound signature that sounds great for music and single-player games, but it's limited sound-stage and closed-back nature can make it feel cramped and not good for FPS games. While I adore the sound signature, if comfort is a big concern you may be disappointed.",
          "Si bien son un poco caros, son audifonos premium de alta calidad con un sonido increible, no se sienten pesados, las almohadillas son comodas incluso durante largas sesiones de uso, la diadema es de buena calidad y se extiende bastante. Totalmente recomendados.",
          "",
          "These headphones are not bass cannons by any means. Reviewers saying these are bass heavy are probably used to very flat sounding audiophile headphones. If all you care about is the amount of muddy bass then go with a pair of Sony MDRXB's. Where these headphones excel is the ability to deliver great clear bass that isn't muddy, as well as crystal clear vocals. They sound very good out of the box but I would recommend an external Amp or DAC that has bass controls on it as it does improve the sound quality. The soundstage is better than most consumer headphones in this price range but not as good as the DT 770 Pro, however these do not have any of the harsh treble that the DT 770 has which can be ear-piercing at times, and they have much better bass.\n\nThe headphones are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn. They are even comfortable when wearing glasses. The clamping force isn't very tight so they would not be the best pair of headphones to walk down the street with on. They also have good passive noise isolation but not great as they don't clamp on your head too tight.\n\nThe materials all feel very premium. The leather on the earcups is very nice to the touch and feels much better than leather earcups on other headphones in the same price range.\n\nThe included hard-shell case looks great and doesn't feel cheap by any means. It is a tad larger than other headphone cases however this makes it very easy to put them in the case or take them out on the fly which I prefer.\n\nThe mic quality is good but not great. I have $50 earbuds that have a better microphone than these but they are still good enough for phone/video calls and I have never had anyone on the other end complaint that they couldn't hear me.\n\nI had an issue with my headphones when they arrived. One of the earpads had been damaged in the shipping process and wouldn't stay on the earcup. Customer support was very quick to fix the issue and offered to ship me new earpads, and entirely new headset, as well as compensation which I was not expecting from a premium headphone manufacturer. A+ customer support from a small vendor.\n\nI would recommend these headphones if:\n-You listen to a wide variety of music which includes bass heavy tracks as well as more vocal focused music.\n-You will mainly be using these headphones while stationary such as at a desk.\n-You want comfortable headphones you can wear all day.\n-You want to enjoy your music and not analyze every note.\n\nI would not recommend these headphones if you only listen to one genre of music or need exceptional passive noise isolation.",
          "Jamais entendu un son aussi naturel de cette qualit\u00e9, avec en prime des bonnes basses !!! Et que dire du confort, gr\u00e2ce au double arceau on ne le ressent absolument pas sur sa t\u00eate !! Gros coup de c\u0153ur",
          "",
          "What can I say these are amazing, you hear things in the music that you don\u2019t hear from cheaper headphones.\n\nI use AirPods for convenience and when I want to sit down and just listen to music I use these. I currently just use Apple Music with the highest quality possible and just plugged in to my phone. I do plan on getting an amp but I\u2019m debating whether they can sound better.\n\nAnyway I am very happy with these.",
          "Os contar\u00e9 mi experiencia de c\u00f3mo y porqu\u00e9 llegu\u00e9 a escoger estos auriculares, los Meze 99, y cu\u00e1l es mi opini\u00f3n sobre ellos, porque personalmente a la hora de gastarme esta cantidad de dinero me gusta estar lo m\u00e1s seguro que puedo de mi compra y las opiniones detalladas me son de gran ayuda a la hora de decidir, aunque la mayor\u00eda de las que le\u00ed se centraban casi \u00fanicamente en la calidad de sonido y creo que hay otros aspectos importantes a la hora de escoger unos auriculares que te tienen que durar mucho tiempo. As\u00ed que procurar\u00e9 no dejarme nada y ser totalmente sincero.\n\nAntes que nada, al comprar unos auriculares hay que tener muy claro el uso que les vas a dar y el presupuesto del que dispones. Tambi\u00e9n evaluar si los quieres con cable o bluetooth (se dice que con el bluetooth pierden informaci\u00f3n de sonido). En mi caso buscaba unos auriculares que me permitieran disfrutar de una experiencia inmersiva, pues los usar\u00eda principalmente en el autob\u00fas. Por este motivo me decant\u00e9 por unos de diadema circumaurales (los que envuelven toda la oreja. Existen tambi\u00e9n los intraurales, que son los peque\u00f1os que te metes dentro del o\u00eddo, y los supraurales, que son de diadema pero no cubren toda la oreja), pues suelen dar m\u00e1s calidad de sonido y me parecen m\u00e1s c\u00f3modos.\nMi presupuesto era de 200 euros aprox. como m\u00e1ximo.\n\nEn casa tengo unos Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro que utilizo para edici\u00f3n de audio. Estos dan una calidad de sonido excelente y neutro y cumplen su funci\u00f3n a la perfecci\u00f3n dentro del estudio, pero necesitaba ahora unos cascos vers\u00e1tiles y de uso m\u00e1s l\u00fadico, no para editar sino para disfrutar de m\u00fasica de distintos g\u00e9neros en cualquier parte, y los Beyerdynamic no eran recomendables para llevar a la calle por varios motivos:\n\u2022Tienen una impedancia muy alta (si desconoces qu\u00e9 es la impedancia, vale la pena informarse) de 250ohms, y por lo tanto a la hora de escuchar m\u00fasica desde el m\u00f3vil se oye muy flojo; necesitan ser conectados a la tarjeta de sonido que tengo en casa (existen tambi\u00e9n amplificadores port\u00e1tiles) para sacarle todo su potencial. Por lo tanto necesitaba unos con una impedancia baja.\n\u2022Son auriculares semi-abiertos, es decir, no a\u00edslan el sonido exterior. En mi caso eso es una pega por que en el bus molestas a los otros pasajeros. Del mismo modo tambi\u00e9n oyes al beb\u00e9 llor\u00f3n del asiento delantero. Por lo tanto necesitaba unos de cerrados (que tambi\u00e9n me servir\u00edan a la hora de grabar voces).\n\u2022Tienen un cable exageradamente largo, pues est\u00e1n pensados para utilizar en estudio, pero fuera de \u00e9l es un contra pues necesitas algo portable y pr\u00e1ctico. Por lo tanto necesitaba unos con cable ligero y extra\u00edble.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, hay otros aspectos a tener en cuenta que, despu\u00e9s de mirar diversas listas de mejores cascos, no he visto.\nEstos aspectos son:\n\u2022Que se puedan quitar las almohadillas, pues al cabo de un tiempo se ensucian y hay que lavarlas.\n\u2022Que el cable sea de quita y pon, para reemplazarlo si se rompe o poder intercambiarlo por otro m\u00e1s largo o corto seg\u00fan te convenga.\n\u2022Que sean ergon\u00f3micos para pod\u00e9rtelos poner en el cuello.\n\u2022Que tengan una buena funda para que no se rompan en el transporte del uso diario.\n\nOtras caracter\u00edsticas que para m\u00ed tambi\u00e9n son importantes son el dise\u00f1o y los materiales de construcci\u00f3n.\n\nComo es l\u00f3gico es muy dif\u00edcil encontrar unos cascos que cumplan tantos requisitos. A\u00fan as\u00ed, hice una b\u00fasqueda intensiva durante varios d\u00edas, y me decid\u00ed por los Audio Technica M50x (que tambi\u00e9n tienen la versi\u00f3n en bluetooth), del que le\u00ed innumerables rese\u00f1as positivas. As\u00ed que fui a probarlos a mi tienda habitual y me sorprendi\u00f3 lo incre\u00edblemente malos que eran: inc\u00f3modos, se escuchaban de pena, (adem\u00e1s de bastante feos y constru\u00eddos enteramente en pl\u00e1stico, cosas que ya sab\u00eda pero podia sacrificar en pro de lo otro que supuestamente ten\u00eda).\n\nAs\u00ed que me puse de nuevo a buscar y a leer opiniones y encontr\u00e9 unos auriculares que me atrajeron de entrada por su particular dise\u00f1o: los Meze 99. Vi tambi\u00e9n que se pod\u00eda quitar el cable (algo de lo que disponen muy pocos modelos), que ten\u00edan una impedancia asombrosamente baja (26ohms) y aunque eran de una marca hasta entonces desconocida para m\u00ed, hab\u00eda muy buenas rese\u00f1as.\nMe gustaron mucho pues era el \u00fanico modelo que cumpl\u00eda con todo lo que buscaba, pero no lo ten\u00edan en mi tienda de confianza as\u00ed que me arriesgu\u00e9 y los compr\u00e9 sin probarlos previamente. Aunque los Classic me flipan, al final me qued\u00e9 con el Neo por ser 100 euros m\u00e1s barato y tambi\u00e9n es atractivo (lo compr\u00e9 en enero 2021 por 200 euros).\n\nEscribo todo esto pues, despu\u00e9s de un mes de haberlos adquirido y probado regularmente. He de confesar que me han sorprendido gratamente. Mis espectativas ya eran altas, pero al abrir su cuidada caja, ver su elegante funda r\u00edgida y descubrir unos cascos que se ven fant\u00e1sticos (est\u00e1n tremendos y se palpa calidad cuando los sostienes) con sus acabados met\u00e1licos, me qued\u00e9 realmente sorprendido. Adem\u00e1s del cable y la funda, incluye un adaptador jack.\n\nSu calidad de sonido es buena si la comparo con los Beyerdynamic, que son una bestia. No soy un entendido en la materia pero no creo que exageren ninguna frecuencia; estan bastante equilibrados.\nDestaco que, como otros cascos cerrados que he probado, al cabo de una hora larga de escucha, tienes que quit\u00e1rtelos un rato pues te empiezan a molestar las orejas.\nTambi\u00e9n quiero comentar que me los enviaron en su caja original, sin ning\u00fan otro envoltorio que la cubriera, y se podr\u00edan haber da\u00f1ado f\u00e1cilmente durante el transporte, cosa que por suerte no pas\u00f3. No se si esto es cosa de amazon, del propio fabricante o de la compa\u00f1ia de reparto.\n\nEn caso de que le encontrara pegas en un futuro reeditar\u00eda esta rese\u00f1a, pero se los ve resistentes, un objeto al que probablemente le coger\u00e9 cari\u00f1o y me acompa\u00f1ar\u00e1 durante muchos a\u00f1os.",

              "I use these headphones to work around the house, I use them at the gym to work out, and I use them while I'm doing lawn work.\n\nThe battery life on these headphones is extraordinary. The quality is very high, given the price point. I would easily put these up against most, way more expensive, headphones in both sound and performance.\n\nThe rechargeable case is a really cool feature. It uses USB-C, which I really like. The outward display is excellent. The battery life is extremely long and the quality of the headphones is very good for ear bud style headphones.\n\nThe range of the Bluetooth is phenomenal. I can get around my entire double lot without breaking up. Additionally, the option to charge the case via USB-C or a wireless charger is a really great feature.\n\nThese headphones were easy to pair with any Bluetooth device and quickly adapt to whatever media you're feeding to them.\n\nFrom a person who has owned very expensive wireless headphones in the $200 to $300 range, I would happily buy multiple sets of these headphones in lieu of buying one very expensive set.\n\nAs far as style and comfort goes, these are some of the most comfortable earbuds I've ever worn. They fit very nicely around the ear and they come with a few different attachments so you can change the size of the earbud for maximum comfort. The quality of the sleeves are very high and the fit is very nice. It is very soft and smooth material.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend these to anyone who is an avid listener of podcasts or music on any device and frequently uses headphones to not disturb those around them. These headphones do a great job at canceling outside noise and have a fantastic audio quality to them, especially given their price point. The sleek black design of these with very clear indicator lights makes them as aesthetically pleasing as they are comfortable. The case is very smooth and feels like frosted glass with a clear charging indicator on the front to check the remining capacity of the device. Also much to my surprise the headphones were at 94% charge when they arrived .\n\nOverall, this is just a great product and I would highly recommend it",

              "So far I really like these earbuds. They were extremely easy to connect via Bluetooth on my phone and no other set up besides that was needed. immediately after I took the plastic tabs off of each earbud it began charging from the precharged case that they came in. I really like how the case can be charged via USB and that it gives you a read out on how charged the earbuds are. Using the earbuds they do have quite a bit of bass and the volume can get decently high which I love. I also like that in total there are 3 different sizes on the ear piece part that goes into the ear. So that if the size that comes with it is too big or small you can try these out to get a better fit for your individual ear. I have tried out at least 3 other different types of wireless earbuds and these so far seem to be my favorite just because of the increased base and volume. They also seem to fit comfortably around my ear and don't wiggle too much. I plan to try them out while on a jog and I think they will actually do pretty well. The charging case really is pretty cool. the wireless earbuds snap into place magnetically so that if you have it open in your purse they don't just fall right out and mingle with everything else inside of your purse. The instruction manual is very simple and easy to read it even gives a great grid to refer back to for how to use the button on the wireless earbud. I do wish that it had a separate button for volume increase and volume decrease but so far the button seems to work OK for everything that it needs. Because the earbuds have a primary and secondary designation the batteries are different for each. The battery of the primary earbud dies faster than that of the secondary earbud which is normal. If you get a call on your phone while you're using the earbuds you have the option to answer it with one click or you can reject it with a long click. I really like the company that makes these. I have bought several different models from them and like them all. Very affordable. Considering getting my husband a pair. The manual says that they will stayed paired for up to 33 feet from your phone. They will stay charged for 8-10 hours. It only takes 2 hours to fully charge them on the case. It takes 3 hours for the case to recharge itself. Love how you can be mobile and charge these while out and about.",
              "I've purchased previous headphones from this same company and each time I\u2019m very impressed with their quality. This time, I\u2019m really loving these new headphones because I can use this to speak to friends on the phone while listen to music at the same time.\n\nOkay now, before you read on you need to understand. I wasn't looking for an awesome listening experience. I was looking for a inexpensive set that would produce sound at a level that still makes them useful while flying. I needed something that would last, sound great and have great quality.\n\nThe outside case:\nSmall enough to fit into your pocket or handbag. There is an indicator on the outside that tells you how much battery life is remaining which is so cool and it will constantly charge your headphones when placed within the case. The lid is kept close with a small magnet, which is a nice thought. Unless your trying to close it without making any noise as the mentioned magnet loves to make it close with a very noticeable snap. Charging is very simple and the lights indicating the battery level makes knowing whats going on very easy.\n\nThe buds:\nThey fit nicely, pairing was incredibly easy to complete and they do connect pretty much flawlessly every time they are taken out of the case. They sound great overall. You can control the volume and pause what your watching / listening to on the buds by placing your finger on the right spot.\n\nWith all of that said, if your looking for a set of buds that will give you the performance then it's worth checking out. These are a great budget set that preforms like a budget set."

              "Head phones work great super comfortable and battery lasts forever! my only complaint is that the volume of my device and the headphone volume adjuster are separate so it can be difficult to keep a good volume",
              "Love the head phones, they have a long charge and they are great with blocking out back ground noise",
              "The sound quality is great and the headphones are very comfortable and durable, for the most part. I started using these september year ago, and they worked great and still do in terms of audio. However, as of these past few months, the headphones have had some issues. The outer coating of the headphone padding has started to peel and shed off, leaving black specks on my face and neck. Additionally, the max charge has been steadily falling for a couple of months. Before, I could wake up early, fall asleep with them on, and wake up in the morning without them being on low battery. However, it has gradually dropped to about 18 hours, and today, they were only able to hold a charge for 13 hours. Again, these have seen pretty much daily use from me and have seen some rather unfavorable conditions (nothing too bad, just some light sprinkles and I don't believe water got inside), so this may just be a result of constant use. Maybe not a good choice for long term use, but other than that, I am very satisfied with these",
              "I have been using these for about 5 months, and I am really happy. I find them to be comfortable, decent sound protection, and overall good listening. I keep them charged and in 1-2 hours have never lost power or noticed decreased sound.",
              "They do not cancel all the outside noise but enough that i don't notice it. Sound is surprisingly good considering that I have some hearing loss. Blutooth connects quickly and volumn is easy to set. The earpads are also comfortable which is a big plus for me as I find most to become uncomfortable after just a short time.",
              "The se headphones are effective and give me a great sound for books or music. helpful on airplanes and around house while working. They connected easily to my Bluetooth systems.",
              "When I excitingly opened my box I didn't even bother to see or read anything just took the headphones out. Unsynched my Cowin E7 from my phone and added these. I noticed right away the E7 logo on the side and was like what the heck is this? I grabbed my old pair and was like. Umph whatever.\n\nI put them on and felt a bit off. But again thinking its because they are new silly goose. As you can see from my pictures, I USED AND ABUSED MY COWINS! I make music and they were a downgrade from my JVCs which I had for years. I bought my Cowins in 2019 I believe maybe sooner. I love them. I was shocked at the bass and the clarity of my music, other music and movies alike. They are perfect for the $50 I slapped down vs the $200 for my pair prior.\n\nWell needless to say the sound quality on these are trash in my opinion. I was listening to a song and was like this really isn't right. So I like the genius I am not, put both pairs on and decided to switch back and force between the two during different parts of the song to compare and yeah they don't live up.\n\nThe bass is weak which is a no go for me. The Cowins always had the bass on point so when I plugged into other sources like speakers and my car it was not too much nor too weak. These new E7 I can tell you right now if I don't remember every time to mix correctly will have the bass way too deep every single time. Drawing out other components most likely.\n\nEven trying to watch a movie they are not as loud as my Cowins. I used the hold them side by side and crank it up test. I use to get stopped and stared at on the train, bus or walking, \"Those are seriously loud \ud83d\ude10\" \"Dang those are some good headphones\" \"How are those so loud?\" \"I can hear every word of what your listening to\" are just some of the comments/compliments I have gotten over the years. I do not think I will be getting the same reaction from these E7s.\n\nI'm super saddened by this as I'm seeing the old versions are no longer available. And it sucks. There's nothing wrong with my cowins except they are very stretched out and as you can see the ear covers are just decimated. I think I'm going to gift my son with these new ones as he just uses them to game mostly.\n\nI'm really really sad you guys. Like pressed about this. Those Cowins were perfection. What the heck happened? I'm again really sad I didn't buy 12 of them sooner to be prepared for the dreadful day they stop working on me. I just don't want to think about it.\n\nDid I mention I'm sad?",
              "I\u2019m autistic and I suffer from sensory overload. These headphones have completely changed my life, I wear them every single day and never leave the house without them. They\u2019re comfortable, they\u2019re effective, they take the edge off the noise without shutting me out entirely, they stay connected for hours at a time, the battery lasts for days, the sound quality is great, I could go on and on. By far one of the best headphones you could possibly get for the price. I bought another pair three years ago, the only reason I had to replace them was because I wore them so much the faux leather started peeling off. No other part of the headphones stopped working, just the leather. I got the warranty this time around, so I never have to worry about it again.",

              "I been wanting some over the ear headphones and decided to go with these because I'm a bass lover. These feel and are premium quality. Connecting to Bluetooth is super easy and the app also has a few settings that you can adjust for your preference. After hooking up I put on a song that I know has bass and I let it rip. When I say these sound good even in high bass, it's an understatement. These are the most fun headphones you can get and for the price you can't compete. From now on I will make sure I get a set every other year.",
              "This is my pick of the year! Maybe the century!\n\nI am both Autistic, and also a little biased.\n\nI had the previous generation skull crushers. The left side broke, and skull candy replaced them in warranty for free.\n\nI wore those replacement headphones for about four more years until the bass slider started acting up.\n\nSo when it came time to by a new pair, it was between these and the ANC model. The ANC model was about 100 dollars more, and I\u2019m not a big fan of ANC\u2019s because they usually have a high pitched hiss whenever there\u2019s no noise coming through.\n\nI was super happy when I found the non-ANC model. Because they were cheaper and most closely resembled my old pair.\n\nThe bass is just a touch stronger than the last generation. Highs and mids are nice too.\n\nI really like the bass slider, because anything with a muddy baseline, you can turn down. Also anytime you are listening to an audible book, if the voice is low, you can turn the bass down.\n\nAll in all I would buy these again.\n\nI have recommended to several friends, some Autistic, some not. Everyone that tries them wants a pair and are really excited they are so affordable.",
              "I like these . They really seal to your ears & the sound is nice. However the volume is not all that much. In my opinion the volume could be louder. Thes are however easy to link to Bluetooth & stay linked. Easy to use. Thank you Amazon.",
              "These are extremely comfortable, easy to pack, and the buttons are easy to press and use to connect to different devices. The battery life is INCREDIBLY long and the sound is absolutely incredible from one song to the next. The Quality of the Noise Cancellation is really next level, but not advisable for people, mainly kids or people who are not stationary or in a safe place to use in public. The only reason being that it can block out many or ALL voices that could be trying to get their attention or warn them of obstacles. Thats why I only use these at home, in a vehicle I\u2019m not driving, or when I am doing a solo housekeeping job so I am aware of all the tools I am using.",
              "I wear them mostly to the gym but also at home the sound is amazing the battery life is actually crazy and there so comfortable only thing I noticed is they do slide off a bit when I do certain exercises but that's as expected overall best headphones I've every purchased",
              "Overall I am very pleased with these headphones. I'm not super knowledgeable or picky on sound details so I cannot give a super techy sounding review. That being said if you're a normal person that is just looking for a solid pair of headphones that aren't overpriced these are great. I mainly got these for the gym which they are great for because of the bass. They are not the noise cancelling version so don't get them and write a bad review because of that because you'll look ridiculous. haha. Again very pleased which has been my general experience with skull candy and the extra charging cable thrown in is a nice touch. Well done skull candy.",
              "I've owned the first wireless Crushers and now the Crusher Evo. Like a lot of reviews describe it, they're absolutely fun to use. If you're one of those people who has never owned a Skullcandy product - the 'Crusher bass' is not simply a equalizer bass boost that other headphone companies offer. There's a physical slider on the left headphone earcup right below the orange button. Sliding this upwards increases the vibrations generated by physical components within the headphone itself. You absolutely have to try it on maximum strength on some bass heavy music --- it will literally make your head rattle.\n\nMy personal favourite is watching movies on my ipad with the Crushers. Try out some bass heavy movies like Michael Bay film, flight scenes from Top Gun Maverick, or the ending sequence of Avengers Endgame and you'll understand what I mean. And don't even get me started on playing games with the Crusher Evos --- absolutely mind blowing :)\n\nFor the price you pay for Crusher Evos, they're definitely worth the value compared to other brands at the same price. I also use Tile for my keys/wallet at home, so having that feature built into the headphones is nice. There's also an app that you can download to your phone that allows you to further tweak the audio profile for optimal hearing.\n\nOverall, an awesome product and highly recommended to anyone looking for having a little skull-shaking fun with their movies/music."

              "I recently purchased these Open Ear Headphones and I'm incredibly impressed with their performance across various activities. Here's my detailed review highlighting the pros and cons:\n\n**Pros:**\n1. **Immersive Stereo Sound:** The 16.2mm drivers deliver rich and immersive audio, making every beat crystal clear, whether you're working out, gaming, or simply enjoying music.\n2. **Innovative Open Ear Design:** I love the open ear concept! It allows me to stay aware of my surroundings while enjoying music, ensuring safety during outdoor activities.\n3. **Bluetooth 5.3 Connectivity:** The Bluetooth 5.3 technology provides a stable and seamless connection with my devices, allowing me to move freely without worrying about signal drops.\n4. **Noise-Cancellation Mic:** The noise-cancellation mic ensures clear calls even in noisy environments, making it ideal for work calls and catching up with friends and family.\n5. **Long Battery Life:** With an impressive 45 hours of playtime, these earbuds keep up with my active lifestyle without constantly needing a recharge.\n6. **Comfortable Fit:** The earbuds are lightweight and ergonomically designed, providing a comfortable fit even during extended wear.\n7. **Versatile Usage:** Perfect for sports, workouts, gaming, and everyday use, these headphones are incredibly versatile and cater to all my audio needs.\n\n**Cons:**\n1. **Limited Bass:** While the sound quality is excellent, the bass could be slightly stronger for a more immersive audio experience, especially for bass enthusiasts.\n2. **Not Fully Noise-Isolating:** The open ear design allows ambient sound, which is great for safety but might not be ideal for users seeking complete noise isolation in noisy environments.\n\nIn summary, these Open Ear Headphones are a game-changer for anyone with an active lifestyle. The combination of immersive sound, open ear design, and long battery life makes them a top choice for sports, workouts, and gaming enthusiasts. While there are minor drawbacks, the overall performance and versatility make these earbuds a fantastic investment. Highly recommended!",
              "I was looking for earbuds that didn\u2019t seal my ear canal and that I could listen to my surroundings, and what a great surprise I got with these Truefree O1.\n\nI must say I was a little bit skeptical with the design, they looked a little weird but once you put them on, they feel just great. They\u2019re very lite and comfortable. The fact that they don\u2019t seal the ear canal is very useful, since you can walk or ride a bike or use them at the office and you can still hear what\u2019s going on around you. Sound is decent, first because the driver is pretty large, but bass is not too powerful, mids and highs are nice, so for the casual music listener or for hearing podcasts or audio books they\u2019re really good, for the hard core music listener, these aren\u2019t the best option. Takes a little bit of time to get used to find the touch controls but no big deal.\n\nThe case is rather large but is understandable because of the design of the earbuds. Connecting to the phone is a breeze and they connect really fast just by opening the case. Battery life is awesome, I got almost 10 hours in a single charge.\n\nThese are great for the price and for daily use when you need to be aware of what\u2019s going on in your surroundings, just don\u2019t expect HiFi since these earbuds push the sound to your ears instead on injecting it inside your ear. Great value for the price.",
              "These headphones make for a good option if you want open air pass-through sound. Theses headphones serve a specific purpose; if you want to be able to hear what's around you while listening to music. Ideally this is great for working out or running if you want to be able to hear cars as you're running on the side of the road for safety, these are it! You have to know that going into purchasing headphones like this because you can't expect the same booming quality sound with headphones like this that you would get out of in ear buds. That being said the sound quality is good it serves its purpose for listening to music. The bass is lacking, but that's to be expected. These feel pretty light around my ears not cumbersome. Did bot get uncomfortable after a few hours of wear I was able to run with them And they didn't fall out of place. It comes with a USB a to USB-C charger cord. Thumbs up for going USBC. Connection to my phone was incredibly easy It took no time at all and they came fully charged out of the box. The carrying case however is pretty large as you can see in the picture but these are also larger style buds that wrap around your ear so the case needs to fit a larger object. I wouldn't stick this case in my pocket to walk around with bc of the size, but perfect fit for a backpack or purse or small carrying crossbody bag. Definitely recommend if you're looking for an open ear style headphone. Battery life is solid with ab 10hrs on the headphones and another 45hrs from the case.",
              "Os fones s\u00e3o perfeitos, fi\u00e9is ao an\u00fancio. Se encaixam bem, consigo escutar o som ambiente e curtir minhas m\u00fasicas e outros \u00e1udios. A bateria dura bastante tempo e recarrega r\u00e1pido.",

              "These headphones are excellent value for the money. I tend to use headphones while at work, sometimes for many hours. I have always found it hard to find good sounding headphones / earbuds that are comfortable for lond periods of time, while being able to hear sounds around me. These are excellent! They are very comfortable, and feel kind of like you are wearing glasses. Even with many movements they don't fall off. The sound quality is very good, with good highs, mids, good base (There is a very slight lack in base, but it is very minimal). I really like that there is nothing in going directly in your ear. I feel that it is healthier for your ears, and also isn't gross to share headphones with someone else. I alos take many calls on my headphones (including business calls) so a good microphone is essential. The microphone on these is excellent. I highly recommend these headphones!\n\nThe only thing that could be considered a negative point, is the case is pretty big compared to other brands. It has to be larger to accomodate this style. The benefit is there is lots of battery power so they last a long time. However they aren't great fitting in your pocket for long times. But itn't a big deal, compared to all the good aspects of these headphones.",
              "Con gusto comparto mis puntos de vista y opinion sobre este par de auriculares de la marca truefree que son el modelo 01... primero que nada me sorprende lo comodos que son ya que puedes traerlos puestos por horas y en ningun momento molestan, son muy pero muy comodos y al ser cero intrusivos en los conductos auditivos de las orejas pues eso hace precisamente que sean muy comodos; ahora bien al estar viendo las especificaciones uno puede constatar que cuentan con un driver ENORME el cual hace bastante bien su trabajo y adicionalmente el contar con el codec de audio LDAC pues que mas podria decir, la calidad del audio entregada es muy bella pues se notan matices en la musica que no se lograrian notar con codecs de audio no tan especializados en ello asi que aqui tienen un gran punto a su favor, los tonos altos son cristalinos y bien manejados no calan en los oidos y son muy perceptibles, los tonos medios bien traidos al frente y los tonos bajos si bien no es su punto mas fuerte aun asi se hacen presente de una buena forma bien desenvueltos; obvio para todo ello siempre recomiendo \"jugar\" con los diferentes tipos de ecualizaciones que disponga su equipo ya sea celular o tables o laptop dependiendo para que los vayas a usar.\nOtro excelente beneficio es que soportan dos dispositivos emparejados en este par de auriculares lo cual se agradece mucho y es facil conmutar entre ambos.\nel volumen creo yo es el punto menos fuerte de estos auriculares pues a mi por ejemplo me gusta llevar el audio a niveles mas altos que los tipicos y pues aqui se quedan un poco cortos en ese aspecto, ahora bien aclaro ojo con esto pues estos auriculares estan dise\u00f1ados y pensados en la seguridad al momento de traerlos puestos ya que son del tipo \"abierto\" y no son de los que entran con gomitas al canal auditivo del oido cosa que ya mencione al inicio, dejando esto bien especificado puedo decir que suenan muy detallado, la separacion de instrumentos es muy pero muy buena notandose matices que no podrias escuchar con auriculares sin LDAC y el volumen aunque no es su punto fuerte creo es lo suficientemente alto para disfrutar andando en la calle ya sea en un paseo en bicileta o patines o trotando o caminando y pues en realidad para ello fueron hecho este par de auriculares por lo que aclarado el punto puedo decir que cumplen perfectamente con su cometido.\ncomo manos libres suenan excelente muy claros en todo aspecto ademas de contar con ENC el cual con la ayuda de sus microfonos elimina muy bien el ruido exterior al momento de estar en modo manos libres lo cual dicho ENC no hay que hacer nada al respecto, se activa de forma automatica en las llamadas.\nel estuche de carga es algo grandecito por lo que no es facil llevarlo en la bolsa del pantalon o pants si andas haciendo ejercicio pero facil de trasportar en mochila o por ejemplo en una cangurera y tiene la capacidad de cargar tus auriculares alrededor de 3 veces mas una vez que agotas la bateria de los mismos la cual vamos a tocar de una vez, los auriculares prometen en promedio 10 horas de actividad pero ojo hay que ser cuidadosos en esto ya que a veces nosotros como usuarios no comprendemos como se mide esto, dichas 10 horas de servicio es a un volumen aproximadamente del 70% y con la conmutacion de LDAC apagada ya que todo ello hace que la bateria se gaste mas rapidamente pero si te gusta traer el volumen a todo lo que da y con LDAC encendido todo el tiempo pues el promedio de tiempo ronda las 6 o 6 y media horas el cual es bastante bueno la verdad como sea muy bien.\ncuentan con un modo de baja latencia para cuando juegas el LAG sea casi imperceptible el cual funciona muy bien tambien y algo que me gusto mucho es que Truefree al ser una compa\u00f1ia hermana de SP pues debo comentar que la aplicacion movil de SP funciona perfectamente bien de hecho al momento de estarlos usando por primera vez me mando una actualizacion del firmware lo cual esta por demas excelente para asi siempre tenerlos actualizados como debe de ser.\nen conclusion estamos ante un paquete bien completo la verdad; buen sonido (muy bueno de hecho), buen desempe\u00f1o, buena autonomia, faciles de emparejar y muy comodos asi que si de verdad estas en busqueda de comprarte este par de auriculares para tus jornadas de ejercicio o simplemente de ocio al ir a caminar la verdad no lo dudes que los vas a disfrutar bastante.\ngracias por llegar hasta aqui y espero te haya servido mi experiencia para si tenias alguna duda pues que haya sido resuelta, excelente dia y felices compras!!!",

Sin embargo, esta rese\u00f1a NO est\u00e1 sesgada por eso.\nLos he tenido durante aproximadamente seis semanas y quer\u00eda probarlos en todas las situaciones antes de dar una opini\u00f3n.\n\nComodidad\nSon s\u00faper c\u00f3modos, tanto que a veces olvido que los llevo puestos y puedo usarlos durante horas sin que me lastimen los o\u00eddos.\nSon ideales para el gimnasio, ya que no se caen en absoluto, lo que significa que tampoco se caer\u00e1n durante un trayecto.\nPuedes escuchar la m\u00fasica claramente y todo lo que te rodea, lo cual es excelente desde el punto de vista de la seguridad.\n\nSonido\nNo sab\u00eda qu\u00e9 esperar, ya que no son del tipo que va dentro del o\u00eddo, pero el sonido es genial. Muy claro y no tan agudo como algunos otros que he probado en este rango de precio.\nObviamente, no competir\u00e1n con los muy caros.\nLa \u00fanica peque\u00f1a desventaja es que si el volumen est\u00e1 alto, la persona junto a ti podr\u00eda escuchar lo que est\u00e1s escuchando.\n\nLlamadas\nAqu\u00ed es donde se destacan a\u00fan m\u00e1s.

After a year and a half, it started to make a pitch sound when you turn them on and leave them for 1 min sitting. The only way to turn off that pitch sound is to press the button for noise cancelation, after that it stops making noise, and works great. C:",

              "Overall the audio quality is pretty good, and active noise canceling is kindof decent (coming from a pair of first generation Surface Headphones).\n\nI'm having a couple of problems that basically make these unusable while they are charging though, and I've forgotten to charge them until they are down to 20% a couple of times now. At 20% the bluetooth starts cutting in and out on the microphone connection, which makes them unusable for meetings. You *can* switch to a wired connection, but (A) as far as I can tell the audio jack has no microphone connection, and (2) if you attempt to charge while using the audio jack to at least listen to things, there is a feedback buzz that occurs. I suppose I can at least switch to wired to listen to stuff while I'm working, but that means it's not charging, and I can't have meetings until it is charged... so... while these work great when they have power, I'm going to have to give this a low rating for actual usability for work purposes.\n\nUpdate: After 2 years of use, these are now refusing to stay connected to my PC, and I have no idea why. They stay connected to other stuff just fine, and other things seem to have no issue staying connected to my PC, but this headset just doesn't want to stay connected for some reason. For $140, I kind of expected them to be better, and last longer than they have. I eventually solved the buzzing issue... but I find, these are still not great for the money.",

              "I love these headphones.\n\nMy beloved headphones are my cheap as chips Avantree ANC031s, which you can't get for love nor money anymore. I don't know what happened but, somehow, a \u00a370 set of headphones has the loveliness and sound quality of something 5 times more expensive.\n\nSo, my second favourites *were* my Sony WH-1000XM5, which are significantly more expensive, but slightly, sort of, soulless. That will probably sound weird, but they just feel a little lacklustre, somehow. In any case, husband has adopted those and loves them.\n\nWe needed a third pair for when batteries run low (we are both in headphones throughout the day every day) so we plumped for these - something for us to rotate to if and when we needed to recharge our respective old reliables.\n\nAnd they're marvellous! They're comfortable (although, just quickly, I have a smaller head than husband and I think I find them ever so slightly more comfy than he) and the sound quality is fab. The noise cancelling on them is genuinely cancel-y; it makes any external noises sound sort of tinny, and very far away. Marvellous.\n\nThere's a small robot lady that lives inside them that will tell you how your battery's getting on, too, and that's always fun.\n\nThe only downside is they don't come with a case, but they fit my Avantree case perfectly, so they have a home to go to.\n\nAll in all, I love them. Not as much as my beloved Avantrees, but far more than the Sony WH-1000XM5s, which are like 3 times the price.\n\nCannot recommend them highly enough.",

Hatten 70% nach auspacken und jetzt noch 50, nach einigen stunden spielzeit.\n- der klang hat dann endg\u00fcltig den vogel abgeschossen, denn sie klingen f\u00fcr diese preisklasse (mit 13\u20ac wohl die niedrigste die es gibt) fast schon unversch\u00e4mt gut! (Als langj\u00e4hriger hifi-freak kann ich das wohl beurteilen, da ich selbst seit jahren nur mit kopfh\u00f6rern zwischen 200 und 400\u20ac musik h\u00f6re.)\nEinzig das es sie nur in diesem bescheidenen lachs-ton, den man kaum als farbe bezeichnen kann gibt, ist zu bem\u00e4ngeln. Aber das ist geschmacksache.\nDefinitiv 5 sterne verdient, jederzeit gerne wieder!",

              "je le trouve tr\u00e8s bien, en bluetooth pour la TV : appairage rapide et fiable (tout fonctionne bien, seul b\u00e9mol en tous cas avec ma TV : le son se met en route tardivement si \u00e7a peut aider - moi je mets toujours les sous-titres donc je ne perds que quelques secondes (jusqu'\u00e0 3 ou 4) de bande son).\net en filaire pour ma tablette : du coup pas d'allumage, le casque est g\u00e9r\u00e9 par l'autonomie de la tablette je pense.\nen tous cas : tr\u00e8s content de l'achat.\nje ne suis pas non plus un dingue de puissance ni de rendu hyper top ! je recherche un bon fonctionnement et une \u00e9coute fluide et ni trop aigu\u00eb ni trop grave. donc tr\u00e8s bien pour moi.",

              "They are super comfy, great quality both in sound + manufacturing, I've had a few pairs of over ear headphones in the past and the manufacturing quality of these is far above the others I've tried!\n\nLove the fact that you can either have them Bluetooth or wired as I'm always breaking my headphone cables over time + end up having to throw away the headphones + now when the cable breaks I can just replace it!\n\nI've noticed a bit of a dip in quality when using Bluetooth over aux but that might just be my laptop since it only happens half the time. Also the sound does bleed a lot so not great for quiet spaces if you don't want anyone to hear what you're listening to but I feel like that's the case with most over ear headphones + as soon as you're in like a pub or a busy street bobody is going to hear it anyways \ud83e\udd17\n\nBattery life is super long too!"
